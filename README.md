# Preparation for Creation of Custom Token
## Custom token required to be created for fulfilment of Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers Course Aug - Jan 2020

This repository is the trial of one method for creating the token needed - using truffle and genache, and test driven coding.
This repository merely shows the testing of the methodology by following online tutorials and assessing whether this was appropriate for the coursework task.

Concluded finally that this method while thorough, was too complex for the simple task set at hand so for the moment it is left 'as is', with the intention to return to this and complete it in the future.
